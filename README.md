# Hello there! üöÄ

I'm Zahra, welcome to the journey of me making my first ever online portfolio. So if you've found your way to this README file, chances are you're curious about portfolios and their creation. This marks my debut on GitHub, and I'm excited to share why I've chosen to upload my online portfolio here.

### Why Did I Upload It Here

Choosing GitHub for my portfolio isn't just about technical considerations; it's a way for me to share a story that I'd love others to be a part of. GitHub provides an accessible platform for me to showcase what I'm up to in life and what I've achieved. This isn't just about code; it's a platform for sharing my journey and projects.
